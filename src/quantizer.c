/*Daala codes 64 unique possible quantizers that are spaced out over a roughly
   logarithmic range.
  The table below maps coded quantizer values to actual quantizer values.
  After 0, which indicates lossless, quantizers are computed by
   trunc(e(((coded_quantizer)-6.235)*.10989525)*(1<<4)), which also happens to
   feature strictly equal-or-increasing interval spacing.
  That is, the interval between any two quantizers will never be smaller
   than a preceding interval.
  This gives us a log-spaced range of 9 to 8191 (representing .5625 to
   511.9375 coded in Q4), with quantizer slightly less than doubling every
   six steps.
  The starting point of 9 is not arbitrary; it represents the finest quantizer
   greater than .5 for a COEFF_SHIFT of 4, and results in a lossy encoding
   bitrate typically between between half and 3/4 the bitrate of lossless.*/

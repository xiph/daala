/*Indexing of vetices and edges:
  0--0--1
  |     |
  3     1
  |     |
  3--2--2

  Interpolation formulas:
  i = horizontal position in the destination block, 0...blk_sz - 1
  j = vertical position  in the destination block, 0...blk_sz - 1
  blk_sz = length of an edge in the destination block in pixels
  blk_sz2 = blk_sz*blk_sz
  w[k] = bilinear weight of vertex k:
  w[0] = (blk_sz - i)*(blk_sz - j)/blk_sz2
  w[1] = i*(blk_sz - j)/blk_sz2
  w[2] = i*j/blk_sz2
  w[3] = (blk_sz - i)*j/blk_sz2
  sw[k, oc] = BLEND weight of vertex k in a block with two unsplit edges and
   outside corner oc:
  sw[oc + 0, oc] = w[oc] + w[oc + 1]/2 + w[oc + 3]/2
  sw[oc + 1, oc] = w[oc + 1]/2
  sw[oc + 2, oc] = w[oc + 2]
  sw[oc + 3, oc] = w[oc + 3]/2
  m[k] = motion vector k
  src[m] = source image value of pixel (i, j) offset by the given motion
   vector, bilinearly interpolated from the values at half-pel locations.
  Basic OBMC blending is then just
    src[m[0]]*w[0] + src[m[1]]*w[1] + src[m[2]]*w[2] + src[m[3]]*w[3]

  Subpel at resolutions finer than halfpel is done with bilinear interpolation.
  First, horizontal interpolation is done, and the result is truncated to
   an integer, followed by vertical interpolation and truncation to an
   integer.

  Lots of indexing and finite differences where tiny errors may be made here.
  This is also a good candidate for SIMD optimization.*/

 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * This is the documentation of the C API for the reference implementation
 *  of Daala, a free video codec.
 *
 * \subsection Organization
 * The implementation is subdivided into three separate libraries.
 * - <tt>libdaalaenc</tt> contains routines exclusive to the encoder.
 *   You must link to this if you use any of the functions listed in
 *    \ref encfuncs.
 * - <tt>libdaaladec</tt> contains routines exclusive to the decoder.
 *   You must link to this if you use any of the functions listed in
 *    \ref decfuncs.
 * - <tt>libdaalabase</tt>, containing routines shared by the encoder and the
 *    decoder.
 *   You must link to this if you use any of the functions in this API,
 *    regardless of whether you use the encoder, decoder or both.*/

 *
 * The functions are listed in the order they are used in a typical encode.
 * The basic steps are:
 * - Fill in a #daala_info structure with details on the format of the video
 *    you wish to encode.
 * - Allocate a #daala_enc_ctx handle with daala_encode_alloc().
 * - Perform any additional encoder configuration required with
 *    daala_encode_ctl().
 * - Repeatedly call daala_encode_flusheader() to retrieve all the header
 *    packets.
 * - For each uncompressed frame:
 *   - Submit the compressed frame via daala_encode_img_in().
 *   - Repeatedly call daala_encode_packet_out() to retrieve any video data
 *      packets that are ready.
 * - Call daala_encode_free() to release all encoder memory.*/

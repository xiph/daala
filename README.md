# Daala next-generation video codec

Daala is the codename for a new video compression technology. The effort is a
collaboration between the Mozilla Foundation, the Xiph.Org Foundation and any
other contributors that wish to help. The goal of the project is to provide a
video format that's free to implement, use and distribute, and a reference
implementation with technical performance superior to H.265. 
For more information, see the [Daala wiki][wiki].

To get a sense of how well Daala performs in comparison to other codecs, check

## Hacking on Daala

The wiki has quickstart pages for [Linux/OS X][posix], [Windows][win], and 
[Windows MinGW64][mingw].

Daala uses the [GitHub Issue Tracker][issues] and the [Rietveld][code review]
code review tool. [Jenkins][jenkins] is used for continuous integration.
